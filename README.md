# interactive-slack-bot

This was the demonstration from ConFoo 2023.

You can set up a free Slack account and it will have access to the Slack API: https://slack.com/

The slack API can be found here: https://api.slack.com/apps/

Slack has lots of great documentation: https://api.slack.com/#read_the_docs

This tool used Slack's Bold for JavaScript SDK: https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started

The message (Block Kit format) was created using Slack's UI Block Kit Builder tool: https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder


The notes/slides for how to configure this in the Slack API can be found here (you'd be interested in the 02. items): https://github.com/cggallant/confoo-2023
